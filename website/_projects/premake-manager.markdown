Premake Manager was born for the simple reason that projects like [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) need seamless intergration and interactebility. When i started contributing to premake, there where no plugins, extensions...

So as what happens often in open-source development, i made it myself!

Now a after a couple of iterations premake-manager has a some new siblings: [Premake Manager CLI](https://github.com/lolrobbe2/premake-manager-cli), [Premaker VS](https://github.com/ColtMcG1/Premaker) and many more on the way!
