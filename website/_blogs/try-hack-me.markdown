# Try Hack Me journey from student to carreer.

on the 25th of Februari i had nothing planned in the evening that week so i decided to go to the Tech & Meet session about TryHackMe hosted on campus.
the session was presented by Niels Deryckere, an alumnus of Howest with a passion for ethical hacking and vulnerability research.
The session turned out to be incredibly iteresting, even tough i was studying software engineering.
He began sharing his personal history on how he started out as student tracking simple bugs in his free time to doing it full time.
He also introduced me to the concept of a CVE(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and explained how we as students, with the help of TryHackMe can learn how to track down these CVE's. He also showed common places of where these so called CVE's are declared.

His story was one where continous learning is very important, as it showed me that you are never don learning new things and always have to keep up with the latest trends.
