description: Tech & Meet Belgian Cyber Command
---

Originally I only planned to go to the study night, but since I was still early enough, my buddies convinced me and another friend to go to the Tech & Meet session about the Belgian Cyber Command. There we learned a lot about the general operations of the Belgian Cyber Command. Obviously, all of this information was given under 'NDA'. But there was only a single clause which allowed pictures to be taken. So here is a little diagram.

{% endraw %}

What we also learned during this tech and meet session is that there are active recruitement efforts ongoing, but that the current problem lies in the fact that no one can pas the fysical tests.

After the session we did some networking with the speeker and learned that the aformentioned issue is activly being worked on by removing the fitness test for people wanting to work for the cyber command.

Sadly after the networking i was tired and the Study Night had finished so i went home knowing a bit more about the constant war that is happening in cyber space, so i can sleep knowing that my browser history is safe.
