# early morning

On the morning of 19 November 2024 i got up at rougly 4:30 to get dressed and unlike my partner for the day i was able to drink a morning coffee. As Today was going to be a tough day, because wehere going to Hack The Future wich is a hackathon for Students from every branch of the IT sector. After jamming to some tunes in my car using my own android auto music player application i arrived in Bruge to take the bus. once on the bus everybody slept until we where there.

# The Hackathon 

Me and my fellow student/partner signed up for the .NET challenges, and boy where we challenged. from flying a spaceship to solving intergalatic riddles using C#.

It was an incredible experience to attempt to crack the challenges they threw at us. These where also the kind of challenges where you don't have to code allot but think about algorithms etc. Wich was exactly the kind of challenge i craved.

# The break

There was a break during the middle of the event, wich was a perfect opertunity to talk with the other contestants and to do some networking.
It was also during this time i figured out where the good coffee was, wich would be of crucial importance for the next halve of the Hackathon.

# The Winners?

During the leadup to the anouncement of the winner, there was dinner service.
Wich was delicious and plentiful and continously being served.
During the anouncement for the winners we learned that we did not win, but my partner in crime and i had the best time of our lives. So 10/10 would do it again!
